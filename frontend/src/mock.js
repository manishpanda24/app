  { q: 'How long does it take?', a: '3–4 weeks for a full build, depending on business complexity. Faster turnarounds available for straightforward businesses.' },

The walkthrough session is specifically designed to make you confident owning and updating the model yourself. We also offer a 30-day Q&A window afterward.' },
  { q: 'Do investors actually care about the financial model at the early stage?', a: 'Yes — though what they\'re evaluating changes by stage. At pre-seed, they\'re assessing your strategic thinking and assumptions. At seed and Series A, they\'re scrutinizing unit economics, runway, and the path to profitability. A weak model at any stage raises red flags.' }

  { q: 'How do you find comparable companies at the early stage?', a: 'We use a combination of proprietary databases, public company benchmarks, startup funding databases, and sector-specific research.

The difference between a founder who says "we\'re worth $8M because I said so" and one who presents a comparable analysis, explains their growth-adjusted multiple, and ties it to real sector benchmarks is the difference between a credible and an amateur fundraiser.' },

  { q: "What if I don't have all materials ready?", a: 'That is exactly when this is most useful. We help you identify what is missing and what needs to be built.' },
  { q: 'Do you help fix the gaps?', a: 'Yes — we identify gaps and can support remediation through advisory or related services.' },
  { q: 'Is this suitable for first-time founders?', a: 'Yes — especially valuable for first-time founders navigating fundraising for the first time.' },
  { q: 'Can accelerators use this?', a: 'Yes — we run cohort-based readiness diagnostics for accelerator programs globally.' },

  { q: 'How is this different from just reviewing my pitch deck?', a: 'A pitch deck review covers one document. The Investment Readiness Review covers your entire fundraising package — deck, financials, data room, legal structure, and founder narrative — and evaluates whether they\'re consistent with each other. It\'s an audit of your fundraising readiness, not just one asset.' },
  { q: 'What if I don\'t have all my materials ready yet?', a: 'That\'s actually the best time to do this. We\'ll flag exactly what\'s missing, prioritize what needs to be built first, and help you structure your preparation timeline. You don\'t need a complete package to start — you just need to be ready to build one.' },
  { q: 'Do you help fix the gaps you identify, or just flag them?', a: 'The Investment Readiness Review identifies and prioritizes gaps. Execution of fixes — rebuilding the deck, rebuilding the financial model — can be scoped as separate engagements at a credit toward the review fee.' },
  { q: 'How long does the engagement take?', a: 'The full review takes approximately 10 days from kickoff to debrief. Including the mock Q&A session and post-improvement check-in, the full engagement window is 30–45 days. Most founders use this time to work through their action plan before the check-in.' },
  { q: 'Is this appropriate for first-time founders?', a: 'Especially so. First-time founders are most likely to have blind spots they don\'t know they have. The structured diagnostic approach is particularly valuable for founders who haven\'t been through a full institutional fundraise before.' },
  { q: 'Can accelerators use this as a pre-demo day program?', a: 'Yes — this is one of our core use cases for ecosystem partnerships. We have a cohort version designed to run across all companies in an accelerator cohort in a structured, time-bound format ahead of demo day.' }

These are the highest-value questions for our sessions.' },
  { q: 'Do I need to have a specific problem, or can I use it more generally?', a: 'Having specific questions makes the session significantly more valuable. We do ask you to submit your top questions in advance so we can prepare specific, substantive answers rather than generic frameworks. The more specific the question, the more specific and actionable the answer.' },
  { q: 'How quickly can I book a session?', a: 'Standard sessions are available within 3–5 business days. If you have an urgent situation (active term sheet, imminent investor meeting), we offer priority booking within 24–48 hours — just let us know when you inquire.' },
  { q: 'Who specifically will I be talking to?', a: 'Our advisory team consists of former VC investors, operators who have raised multiple rounds, and advisors with fundraising experience across North American and European markets. We\'ll match you with the advisor best suited to your specific question set and sector.' },
  { q: 'Can I share materials in advance for the advisor to review?', a: 'Yes — and we strongly encourage it. Sending your deck, a specific slide, a term sheet, or a financial model in advance allows the advisor to come prepared with specific, substantive feedback rather than general observations.' },
  { q: 'Is this confidential?', a: 'Completely. Everything shared in your session and submitted in advance is treated as strictly confidential. We do not share any materials or details from your engagement with any third parties.' }
